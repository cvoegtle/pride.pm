Building PriDE
--------------
PriDE comes with an Ant script which allows to build the core library by performing "ant jar". Make shure to prepare the environment correctly by adapting the properties in build.xml and optionally running the shrc.bat file when working a DOS shell.

If you like to compile PriDE from within your favourite IDE, just create your own project and add the sub-directories 'src', 'test', and 'examples' as source folders. The folder 'ant' containes the source code for PriDE's Ant task and requires ant.jar from an Ant distribution 1.6.x or higher.
